Here is the link to the hosted [Tourism NZ website ](https://thomaskingtourismapp.000webhostapp.com/).
My project was hosted on the Hostinger web server.

You will also find the link here to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/vdLZn5SG/4645affbf1ec7cb011fc18023cf4b474/tourism-new-zealand) where the project was completed.
I did a version of my project management on Trello as it was an industry tool that Yoobee encouraged it's students to use.
